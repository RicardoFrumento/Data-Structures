# Data-Structures
These are the programming projects developed during the Data Structures course in the university of South Florida. No code is going to be published before the end of the course.

The first project simulates a x86 call stack in a very simple way. The code is thoroughly commented and uses the following files
- callstack.cpp
- callstack.h
- driver.cpp
- stack.hpp
- template-linkedlist.hpp

The second project implements a binary search tree with specific characteristics. The node must be a tall node (size of one sub tree is double or more of the other sub tree). It uses the following files
- sequoia-driver.cpp
- sequoia.cpp
- sequoia.h
- input.txt

The third project implements a topological sort and a cycle detection algorithm. It uses the following files
- digraph.cpp
- digraph.h
- project3-driver.cpp
- graph.txt
