# Data-Structures

The first project simulates a x86 call stack in a very simple way. The code is thoroughly commented and uses the following files
- callstack.cpp
- callstack.h
- driver.cpp
- stack.hpp
- template-linkedlist.hpp

The second project implements a binary search tree with specific characteristics. The node must be a tall node (size of one sub tree is double or more of the other sub tree). It uses the following files
- sequoia-driver.cpp
- sequoia.cpp
- sequoia.h
- input.txt

The third project implements a topological sort and a cycle detection algorithm. It uses the following files
- digraph.cpp
- digraph.h
- project3-driver.cpp
- graph.txt
